  "description": "Spotted salamander, spotted lizard, fire lizard - a species of tailed amphibian from the salamander family with a characteristic appearance and a wide range of occurrence. It leads a solitary, predatory lifestyle. There are numerous subspecies. The scientific and Polish names of the amphibian probably date back to the Persian language, in which the word means 'living in fire'. However, it may also come from the Arabic word samandar, under which name the salamander is still used in Arabic and Persian."
